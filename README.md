# SmartNest: Advanced Nest Monitoring System 🐦🔍
SmartNest is an innovative nest monitoring system designed to assist researchers in studying the unique adaptations of endangered Ground-Hornbill birds to rising temperatures. Developed as a final-year project at the University of Cape Town, SmartNest combines cutting-edge technology with a user-friendly interface to revolutionize avian research.

# Features 📋
Motion-triggered Cameras 📷: High-quality cameras capture images and videos both inside and outside the nest, triggered by Ground-Hornbill movements.
Temperature Logging 🌡️: Accurate temperature readings are recorded to study the impact of rising temperatures on nestlings.
Intuitive Web Interface 🌐: Researchers can conveniently preview and retrieve data through a user-friendly web application, accessible via smartphone or desktop.
Wireless Connectivity 📶: Data is seamlessly transferred from the nest monitoring system to the web interface, ensuring real-time access to valuable research data.
Robust and Weatherproof Design ☔: The system is designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions, ensuring reliable operation in the field.
